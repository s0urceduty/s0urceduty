Sourceduty Inc. is a pure holding corporation owned solely by Alex Aldridge, founded in Ontario, Canada in late 2022. Rather than operating as a service-based or sales-driven business, Sourceduty functions exclusively as an intellectual property, capital, and rights management entity. The company holds an expansive digital portfolio that did include more than ~~200 custom 3D model assets~~ and over ~~6,000 custom GPT assets~~, reflecting years of intensive development in creative technology, software architecture research, scientific communication, and conceptual innovation. The name “Sourceduty” was originally inspired by the fusion of source code and task-driven development, symbolizing a deeper commitment to foundational digital work rather than obligation-based commerce. Secured across multiple platforms along with its .com domain in 2022, the brand has evolved into a centralized ownership vehicle that protects and consolidates digital creations, research archives, legal claims, and future capital allocations under a single corporate structure. Although Sourceduty remains a one-person corporation, it represents a globally oriented vision focused on long-term influence in digital systems, open knowledge infrastructure, and technological accountability rather than conventional market participation.

Sourceduty uses 0.0 instead of 0.0.0 is a purposeful strategy to reduce bugs by simplifying how software state, stability, and change are communicated during development and repair. By avoiding multi-segment version numbers, the system eliminates false signals of maturity and precision that can lead developers to make incorrect assumptions about readiness, compatibility, or behavior. This simplification removes the need to debate or automate patch-level increments, reduces version-based branching logic, and keeps attention focused on correctness rather than bookkeeping. 

Also, Alex prefers to develop Python projects using large, single-file architectures that maintain internal modular formatting rather than splitting functionality across many small files. This approach allows cohesive structural control while preserving readability through clearly separated sections such as classes, functional blocks, configuration regions, and logical headers.

Building and developing with Sourceduty’s shared open-source Python functions creates a modular foundation for rapid experimentation, structured prototyping, and scalable software design. Because the functions are organized around reusable computational patterns, developers can combine them into larger systems without rewriting core logic, accelerating innovation across simulations, image processing, logic modeling, and scientific experimentation. This open structure encourages collaborative refinement, where improvements can compound over time into a powerful shared toolkit. Even beyond Python, these functions can serve as architectural references or be translated into other languages such as JavaScript, C++, or Rust, especially when supported by an AI chatbot.
