Sourceduty Inc. is a pure holding corporation owned solely by Alex Aldridge, founded in Ontario, Canada in late 2022. Rather than operating as a service-based or sales-driven business, Sourceduty functions exclusively as an intellectual property, capital, and rights management entity. The company holds an expansive digital portfolio that includes more than 200 custom 3D model assets and over 6,000 custom GPT assets, reflecting years of intensive development in creative technology, software architecture research, scientific communication, and conceptual innovation. The name “Sourceduty” was originally inspired by the fusion of source code and task-driven development, symbolizing a deeper commitment to foundational digital work rather than obligation-based commerce. Secured across multiple platforms along with its .com domain in 2022, the brand has evolved into a centralized ownership vehicle that protects and consolidates digital creations, research archives, legal claims, and future capital allocations under a single corporate structure. Although Sourceduty remains a one-person corporation, it represents a globally oriented vision focused on long-term influence in digital systems, open knowledge infrastructure, and technological accountability rather than conventional market participation.

As a pure holding corporation, Sourceduty Inc. does not offer services or commercial products, but instead serves as the strategic command center for litigation, asset preservation, and capital deployment. Alex Aldridge’s long-term vision integrates high-impact advocacy with large-scale investment initiatives, including planned financial support for IIHS-HLDI and Euro NCAP to expand crash testing into the luxury and hypercar sectors, direct contributions to the Canadian Cancer Society, and potential acquisition or structural expansion of Frontiers to reinforce open-access scientific publishing. These initiatives align with a broader philosophy centered on transparency, safety, academic freedom, and systemic reform in digital and technological ecosystems. Ongoing large-scale legal actions—including claims involving platform scalability limits, digital asset rights, monopolistic structures, and platform governance—form part of the corporation’s broader accountability strategy. While financial projections connected to litigation remain uncertain and subject to judicial outcomes, the structural intent is clear: Sourceduty Inc. operates as a sovereign-style private holding entity designed to consolidate intellectual property, enforce rights, and deploy capital in ways that amplify long-term societal impact, all while remaining under sole ownership and control.

Sourceduty uses 0.0 instead of 0.0.0 is a purposeful strategy to reduce bugs by simplifying how software state, stability, and change are communicated during development and repair. By avoiding multi-segment version numbers, the system eliminates false signals of maturity and precision that can lead developers to make incorrect assumptions about readiness, compatibility, or behavior. This simplification removes the need to debate or automate patch-level increments, reduces version-based branching logic, and keeps attention focused on correctness rather than bookkeeping.
