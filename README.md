Sourceduty is a digital creative development company founded by Alex Aldridge in late 2022, based in Canada but with a vision that extends globally. As a self-taught designer, inventor, and software architecture developer, Alex brings his unique blend of talents to the company, which specializes in sharing open-source codes, framework, computer science, concept ideas, and creative inspiration. 
Since 2022, this company has steadily grown, with an impressive portfolio that includes over ~~200 custom 3D model assets~~ and more than ~~25000 custom GPT assets~~. These numbers continue to grow as Alex persistently drives innovation and expands the company’s capabilities, envisioning a long-term trajectory into the deep future of the internet. Over the next decade, Sourceduty plans to evolve into a major player in the digital creative landscape, leveraging its strong foundation in open-source collaboration and digital asset creation. Sourceduty utilizes a plan-driven build and fix development style.

The name "Sourceduty" was inspired by source codes and duties or tasks. There is more source work than obligation to a duty. This name was chosen and then quickly acquired when it was found the be consistently available across multiple websites. The .com domain for this name was also available and acquired at the same time. As a sole proprietorship, Sourceduty is on the cusp of transforming into a larger business, poised to scale while maintaining its creative identity. With Alex’s boundless tenacity at the helm, the company is not only set to endure but to lead in shaping the future of digital creativity and open-source collaboration for years to come. 

Sourceduty’s use of 0.0 instead of 0.0.0 is a purposeful strategy to reduce bugs by simplifying how software state, stability, and change are communicated during development and repair. By avoiding multi-segment version numbers, the system eliminates false signals of maturity and precision that can lead developers to make incorrect assumptions about readiness, compatibility, or behavior. This simplification removes the need to debate or automate patch-level increments, reduces version-based branching logic, and keeps attention focused on correctness rather than bookkeeping. Treating fixes as direct state corrections rather than transitions between artificial version milestones lowers complexity, limits divergent code paths, and reduces the chances of regressions. Overall, the 0.0 approach aligns expectations with reality, discourages premature reliance on unstable software, and turns versioning itself into a preventative engineering mechanism rather than a source of confusion or error.
