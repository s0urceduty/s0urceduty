Over the next decade, Sourceduty plans to evolve into a major player in the digital creative landscape, leveraging its strong foundation in open-source collaboration and digital asset creation. Sourceduty utilizes a plan-driven build and fix development style.

The name "Sourceduty" was inspired by source codes and duties or tasks. There is more source work than obligation to a duty. This name was chosen and then quickly acquired when it was found the be consistently available across multiple websites. The .com domain for this name was also available and acquired at the same time. As a sole proprietorship, Sourceduty is on the cusp of transforming into a larger business, poised to scale while maintaining its creative identity. With Alex’s boundless tenacity at the helm, the company is not only set to endure but to lead in shaping the future of digital creativity and open-source collaboration for years to come.
